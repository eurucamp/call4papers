The eurucamp Call for Papers application allows users to submit conference proposals or suggest speakers. Signup works through Github or Twitter.

## Donationware

This app was originally created by the team from [wroc_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com/).

This app is currently maintained by members of the Ruby Berlin e.V. on their free time as a community effort for the eurucamp conference. Ruby Berlin is the body behind RailsGirls Berlin and Hamburg, eurucamp, JRubyConf.eu and the Ruby User Group Berlin.

If you end up using the app, please get in [contact](mailto:info@eurucamp.org) so that we know. Also, spread the word about our [projects](http://rubyberlin.org). Also, consider [donating](https://www.betterplace.org/en/organisations/ruby-berlin/), especially, if you run a commercial conference. We are a registered non-profit, donations are tax deducible. Betterplace handles all paperwork - if in doubt, send us a mail.

If you cannot or don't want to donate - use it, it's free.
