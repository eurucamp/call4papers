The eurucamp Call for Papers application allows users to submit conference proposals or suggest speakers. Signup works through Github or Twitter.

## Donationware

This app was originally created by the team from [wroc_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com/).

This app is currently maintained by members of the Ruby Berlin e.V. on their free time as a community effort for the eurucamp conference. Ruby Berlin is the body behind RailsGirls Berlin and Hamburg, eurucamp and JRubyConf.eu.

If you end up using the app, please get in [contact](mailto:info@eurucamp.org) so that we know. Also, spread the word about our [projects](http://rubyberlin.org). Also, consider [donating](https://www.betterplace.org/en/organisations/ruby-berlin/), especially, if you run a commercial conference. We are a registered non-profit, donations are tax deducible. Betterplace handles all paperwork - if in doubt, send us a mail.

If you cannot or don't want to donate - use it, it's free.
